## Some Theory
<div>
  <ul>
  <li>CAPM provides a useful measure that helps investors determine what return they deserve on an investment, in exchange for putting their money at risk on it.  </li>
  <li>It describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. </li>
    <li>Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the time value of money. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. </li>
    <li>The goal of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared to its expected return. </li>
  </ul>
